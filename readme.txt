Hi, Crasch here.

I made this thing. In this folder you will find the server.exe file. This is the compiled file and can run on its own,
you just have to start it. You can disregard the warning, it doesnt need any permissions. The rest is the source code (JS dir).

In the folder is the current test rig. You will need to change one path, just follow the instructions of that yellow sign.

Todo: 
-change the output dir to be hosted on the server,
-maybe try other languages
-bugfixes (currently no known)
-finish the readme
